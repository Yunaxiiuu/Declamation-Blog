        <h2>Speech by Rhian Praxides</h2>
        <p>Good [morning/afternoon], everyone. My name is Rhian Praxides, and today I want to talk about discrimination—a force that continues to divide us and undermine the dignity of many, whether it's based on race, gender, or other factors. How can we call ourselves human if we refuse to see humanity in others? No one is born to hate, yet we teach it through fear and ignorance. Discrimination steals opportunities, crushes dreams, and leaves scars that may never heal. We are all different, but these differences make the world beautiful, not broken. Why should anyone feel less than another when we all share the same earth and breathe the same air? Let us choose acceptance over prejudice, love over hate. Every small act of kindness is a step toward a better, fairer world. Together, we can break the chains of discrimination and build a future where everyone belongs.</p>

        <h2>The Experience</h2>
        <p>Participating in the Declamation Program has been an incredible journey—one I never expected to enjoy so much. At first, I was intimidated by the idea of speaking in front of an audience. The thought of memorizing and delivering a speech felt overwhelming, but as the program progressed, I started to truly appreciate the experience.</p>
        <p>What made it so amazing was how it pushed me out of my comfort zone in such a positive way. Each session allowed me to sharpen my communication skills and build my confidence. I didn’t just learn how to speak more clearly—I learned how to express my thoughts with passion, how to captivate an audience, and how to engage with people in ways I hadn’t imagined before.</p>
        <p>What I found even more rewarding was how much fun the program turned out to be. It wasn’t just about memorizing speeches and practicing delivery; it was about connecting with others, sharing experiences, and growing together. Every practice session and every speech felt like a new discovery—both of my abilities and of my potential.</p>
        <p>By the end of the program, I felt so much more confident in myself, not just as a speaker, but as a person. I learned valuable lessons in discipline, self-expression, and overcoming fear. It was an experience that not only improved my public speaking skills but also shaped how I see challenges and how I approach them.</p>
        <p>I can honestly say that the Declamation Program has been one of the most enriching, enjoyable, and transformative experiences I’ve ever had, and I’m grateful for every moment of it.</p>
